# Rust Breach Searcher

### Simple Breach Searcher

Simple rust program to search a folder with breaches. Provide a folder directory, and it will search through each file within that folder, searching for a query you specify.

### Example

```bash
jwe0@Ubuntu:~/Desktop/Side/Rust-Breach-Searcher$ cargo run
Breach Folder: /path/to/folder
Query: example_query
Output File: /path/to/output.txt
Output? (y/n): y
jwe0@Ubuntu:~/Desktop/Side/Rust-Breach-Searcher$ 

```

### Notes

- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the folder and its files.
- This program assumes text-based files and searches for the query within the content of these files.
